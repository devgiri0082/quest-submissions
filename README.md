## Chapter 1 Day 1 quests

1.Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words/

- Blockchain is a shared databse for storing information, it is public so anybody can take part in it and see all the information stored in it, it is also decentrilized so no one person controls the blockchain and it is open for anyone to join and leave at anytime.

2.Explain what a Smart Contract is.

-  Smart contract are programs that are stored on blockchain. Smart contracts can be called by an account to perform predetermined action like making a transaction or storing a data on the blockchain. Smart contract are very fast, efficient and accurate so they are very useful but we have to use it with caution since they can be hard to get right and possibly malicious if the developer intented it to be.


3. Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.

        Script                                                                                Transaction
        
        1) Sript are used to view data on the blockchain        |                1) Transaction are used to change data on the blockcain
        2) They are free                                        |                2) They are not free
        3) It can not change data on the blockchain             |                 3) It can change data on the blockchain

## Chapter 1 day 2 quests

1. What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?

- Four pillars of Cadence programming language are:
        1. Safety & security
        2. Clarity
        3. Approachability
        4. Developer Experience
        5. Resource Oriented Programming
  
2. In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?

- Safety & Security
       <br/> Safety and Security can help programmer to write code without worrying about different gotchas and vulnerability.
        
- Clarity
       <br/> Cliarity helps increase the readability of the code so everyone can easily understand how the code is working.
        
- Apporachability
       <br/> If it is approachable then beginner developer can easily jump on the band wagon and start developing their DAPP.

- Developer Experience
        <br/>I mean no body wants to filp their finger to the code everytime something goes wrong.

## Chapter 2 day 1 quests

1. Deploy a contract to account 0x03 called "JacobTucker". Inside that contract, declare a constant variable  named is, and make it have type String. Initialize it to "the best" when your contract gets deployed.

2. Check that your variable is actually equals "the best" by executing a script to read that variable. Include a screenshot of the output.
